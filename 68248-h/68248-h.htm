<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i001.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Once there were two little kittens that did not
wear any mittens. All they wore were coats—the
one yellow and the other black. They both had
blue, blue eyes, and sharp teeth and feet like
cushions and scratchy claws, and they were
EXACTLY THE SAME AGE!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i002.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>At first they lived on a farm, where there were
so many kittens that no one ever paid any attention
to them. They had nothing to eat but mice!
They had nothing to lie on but hay! And worst
of all they had no names!</p>

<p class='c008'>At last they decided to go out into the world
and seek their fortune. All they wanted was a
home and two pretty names.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i003.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>They grew very tired walking over the long,
dusty roads. But at last they spied some little
white cottages, nestled down among the green
trees. They walked right up to the very first
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Meow! Meow!” they cried, “Please let us come
in!” A cross old lady opened the door and said
“SCAT!” My how they ran!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then they walked to the second door. “Meow!
Meow!” they cried, “Please let us come in!”</p>

<p class='c008'>A hobblety old gentleman came to the door.
“RATS!” he said, and struck at them with his
cane. My how they ran again!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i005.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>They wondered whether they should try the
next door. At last they went up quite timidly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“MEOW! MEOW!” they cried, “PLEASE LET
US COME IN!” A dear little girl opened the
door. “Mother, look at the kitties!” she said.
“May they come in?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i006.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mother nodded her head, and the two little
kittens marched right into the room! They tried
to jump on the couch. They were tired and they
wanted to sleep. But the lady said, “No, you are
too dirty! Come Irene, we will give them a bath.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i007.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>So they were put into a little tub and scrubbed!
They were dried with a soft cloth! My, how
fluffy and puffy they looked then!</p>

<p class='c008'>Irene hugged them close to her heart. “You
shall be my twins!” she said, “and your names
shall be FLUFF and PUFF.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then the kitties purred with delight. They
had found A HOME and TWO PRETTY
NAMES! They thought their troubles were
ended. But they had never lived in a house
before. They were used to the barn.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day Irene could not find Fluff anywhere.
Black Puff was the only one on the couch when
she came home.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Puff meowed and meowed. He kept looking
up. Then Irene looked up too! Fluff had climbed
up the curtain and could not get down. “You’ll
never find milk or mice on the ceiling, Fluff!”
she said, after Mother had gotten her down.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Irene was knitting a pretty blue scarf. One
morning she laid it on the couch while she went
to talk to a little friend. Suddenly she heard a
noise. Scamper, scamper! Pitter, patter!</p>

<p class='c008'>When she came in the twins were playing with
her ball of blue wool. And part of the scarf was
unraveled and wound around Puff’s neck.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>After she unwound the wool, she locked them
both in the cellar. She thought that would be a
dreadful punishment! But they had a GRAND
TIME! They chased a little mouse that had left
his home in the wall because he didn’t think!
Fluff caught him in the coal bin.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Irene brought them upstairs, Fluff was
as black as Puff. They had to have another bath!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Dear!” sighed Irene, “Twins are such
trouble!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The very next day, when she was writing a
letter to her grandma, Puff jumped on her lap
and spilled the ink! And while she was fetching
a cloth to wipe it up, Fluff tumbled the waste-paper
basket all over the floor!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>That day she locked them in the kitchen. But
they got into more trouble than ever. They
smelled fish!</p>

<p class='c008'>When Irene came to the kitchen, the big fish
mother had bought for dinner was falling from
the table! And Puff and Fluff were having the
worst fight.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“You are bad kitties!” she cried, and she
whipped them! Then she put them out of the
house and shut the door, although her heart
hurt frightfully. “I must train them!” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fluff looked at Puff. Puff looked at Fluff.
“Meow! Meow!” Fluff said, “We have been turned
from our home.” “Meow! Meow!” answered Puff,
“we must go back to the farm!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>When Irene looked for them at dinner-time
they were gone! She looked everywhere! But the
twins were not to be found. She called them until
her throat ached. “Here Puff! Here Fluff!” But
no kitties came running.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she was very sad. “Dear! Dear!” she said,
“They have run away because I punished them!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then Daddy came home, “Oh, Daddy!” Irene
cried, “my TWINS have RUN AWAY! We must
go and find them!” So right after dinner Daddy
got out the big car. Soon they were way, way out
in the country. The sun was going down behind
the hills. “Oh!” sobbed Irene, “I am afraid they
are lost.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Daddy stopped the car with a jerk.
He had almost run over the TWIN KITTIES!
Irene jumped out and picked them up. Soon Puff
and Fluff were on their way back home. They were
very happy to be cuddled in Irene’s arms.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>She held them very close. “Dear Kitties,” she
said, “you must take your punishments bravely.
If I did not correct your faults when you are
kittens, you would grow up into BAD CATS!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Fluff and Puff rolled up into two little balls.
They were so happy that they had such a nice,
kind mistress, who trained them so well, and yet
forgave them so readily, that they purred louder
than the engine.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>When they reached home Irene laid them tenderly
on the pretty couch. Then she went up to
bed. Fluff and Puff did not go to sleep at once.
They lay awake planning to show their gratitude
to their nice, kind little girl mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Meow!” said Fluff, “she took us in when no
one else would look at us, and gave us a home!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Mew!” answered Puff. “And she has taught
us how to act in a pretty home like this. We were
not well trained when we came here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“P-r-r-r-r-r!” continued Fluff in a bit softer tone.
“If she hadn’t loved us a lot she would never have
searched for us.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“And we’d be back in the cold, cold barn!”
purred Puff, cuddling down in the warm cushion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“From now on we must be very, very good!”
said Fluff, sleepily. “We—must—be—very—very—good!”
purred Puff softly. Then his head fell
over on Fluff’s back. They were both fast asleep.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
